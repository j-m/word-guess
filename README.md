# ![word guess banner logo](./docs/assets/banner.png) Word Guess

A rapid-fire word game designed to teach players about different linguistic traits of their language and algorithms like binary search.  

In this game, you guess the word letter-by-letter and are told if the actual letter is before or after the letter you guessed, if you guess the same letter incorrectly a second time, you will see both an upper and lower bound of what the actual letter could be.

Currently, this game is focused on challenging friends & family. We're working on adding single player challenges.  

Enter your challenge and click "show seed", share this code with them and they won't know the answer.
